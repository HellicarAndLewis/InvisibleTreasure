# InvisibleTreasure
Show control, Computer Vision and AudioVisual cueing system for an experimental theatre project.

## Summary
Built using openFrameworks 0.84 on OSX 10.10. The main application can run in one of three modes: master, slave and show. Master controls others via OSC.

### Axis 
Connect the axis IP camera to the POE switch and the switch to your computer. Setup the camera as follows:
-   Download and install the [Camera Companion PC client](http://www.axis.com/my/en/products/axis-camera-companion#). (Windows only)
-   Run the client: follow the steps and update the firmware.
-   Setup the camera to expose the overview image as mjpeg at 1024x768.
-   Once setup, the motion jpg should then be accessible at http://{CAM_IP}/axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi. Note: you wonâ€™t be able to access this link in a browser. To check the feed, just visit the camera IP address. You should see the overview mjpeg.


### Settings & Control
